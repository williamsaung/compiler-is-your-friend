Question #1: Correctness

In TypeScript, write a function called "scriptAt". Prove that it's correct by providing a set of test cases. 
The function will do as follows.

Given a string as an input, find the index of the string "Script" within the input string. 

You can use Google to look up the method calls.

Questions:
1) How to ensure that the input is a string at compile time?
2) What did you learn from this exercise?
I learnt about indexOf function and typescript type in function.
*/ 

function scriptAt(someString: String) {
    console.log(someString.indexOf('Script'));
    // console.log(someString);
}

scriptAt('Script');
scriptAt(1);
